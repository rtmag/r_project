# Accessing mutation data

Hi guys, in this short post I will show you how to access the mutation data so you can explore the data with the code that you learnt in class.

#### Let's load the libraries first.
```R
# Load the TCGAbiolinks library
library(TCGAbiolinks)

# Load the maftools library
library(maftools)

# Source the following collection of functions directly from the internet. This allows us to use the function "createOncoMatrix"
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PoisonAlien/maftools/master/R/oncomatrix.R")
```

# 
```R
